# DrugDroneApp
Entry for HackZurich 2018

This App connects to a drone service which invokes a drone to go to the
nearest drug dispenser to bring the drugs in the emergency. It shows the
current location of the drone to enable the user to see the remaining time
untill salvation.

A use case may be an allergic reaction or an insulin defficiency in a
remote area, where it is known _what_ medication is needed directly
and _instantenous_, without the need for a doctor.

Using this app, much money can be saved by not being spent on services like
Rega, and their resources in turn get saved for other emergencies where a
doctor is really needed.
